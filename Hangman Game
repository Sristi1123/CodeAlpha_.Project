It is a simple text-based game built in Python where the player tries to guess a secret fruit name one letter at a time. The program randomly selects a fruit from a predefined list, and the player gets 5 chances to guess letters. If the player correctly guesses the entire word using valid single-letter inputs, they win! Otherwise, the game reveals the correct word and ends.
